    why people try to make the world like nether?
</h1>
<p>
    The delicate balance of Nature has been disturbed due to increased population of human beings. The activities of mankind have led to decrease in the green cover comprising forest land. This has resulted in many wild animals getting extinct or reaching the brink of extinction.
</p>
<p>
    Increased population results in clearing of forest lands. Encroaching is done for farming, leading to decrease in living space for wild animals.
